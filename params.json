{"name":"LMW-tree","tagline":"web scale clustering","body":"### Learning M-Way Tree\r\nLMW-tree is a generic template library written in C++ that implements several\r\nalgorithms that use the m-way nearest neighbor tree structure to store their\r\ndata. The algorithms and data structures are generic to support different\r\ndata representations and functionality.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms are primarily focussed on computationally efficient clustering.\r\n[Clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) is an\r\n[unsupervised machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)\r\nprocess that finds interesting patterns in data. It can be used for nearest\r\nneighbor search, supervised learning and other machine learning applications.\r\n\r\nThe [Parallel Streaming Signature EM-tree](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/84386/)\r\nhas produced document clusters for the [ClueWeb](http://www.lemurproject.org/clueweb12.php/)\r\nlarge scale web crawls. This result was presented at the [2015 International World Wide Web conference](http://www.www2015.it/accepted-papers/). Document clustering at this scale has not previously\r\nbeen reported.\r\n\r\nSee the [ClueWeb09](http://ktree.sourceforge.net/emtree/clueweb09/)\r\nand [ClueWeb12](http://ktree.sourceforge.net/emtree/clueweb12/) clusters\r\nfor examples of [document clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_clustering)\r\nproduced by the Parallel Streaming Signature EM-tree algorithm. ClueWeb09 and 12\r\ncontain 500 and 733 million web pages and were clustered into 600,000 to 700,000 clusters.\r\nThe document to cluster mappings and other related files area available for [download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ktree/files/clueweb_clusters/).\r\n\r\n### Algorithms\r\n- EM-tree\r\n- K-tree\r\n- k-means\r\n- Tree Structured Vector Quantization (TSVQ)\r\n- Novel variants of all of the above to work with bit vectors, bit strings or signatures.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n## Algorithms and Data Structures\r\n\r\n## Document Representations\r\n\r\n## Information Retrieval\r\n\r\n## Clustering Evaluation\r\n\r\n## Document Clustering and Classification\r\n\r\n## Software\r\n\r\n## Theses\r\n\r\n### License\r\nLMW-tree is licensed under the BSD license.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n- Lance De Vine (@ldevine)\r\n- Chris de Vries (@cmdevries)\r\n\r\nThis project has been supported by the Queensland University Technology via the Big Data Lab and the Deputy Vice Chancellor's PhD scholarship.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving troubles with LMW-tree?\r\n\r\nHave feedback?\r\n\r\nContact [Chris de Vries](mailto:chris@devries.zone) via email.\r\n","google":"UA-63574259-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
