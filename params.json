The algorithms and data structures are generic to support different\r\ndata representations and functionality.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms are primarily focussed on computationally efficient clustering.\r\n[Clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) is an\r\n[unsupervised machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)\r\nprocess that finds interesting patterns in data. It can be used for nearest\r\nneighbor search, supervised learning and other machine learning applications.\r\n\r\nThe [Parallel Streaming Signature EM-tree](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/84386/)\r\nhas produced document clusters for the [ClueWeb](http://www.lemurproject.org/clueweb12.php/)\r\nlarge scale web crawls. This result was presented at the [2015 International World Wide Web conference](http://www.www2015.it/accepted-papers/). Document clustering at this scale has not previously\r\nbeen reported.\r\n\r\nSee the [ClueWeb09 clusters](http://ktree.sourceforge.net/emtree/clueweb09/)\r\nand the [ClueWeb12 clusters](http://ktree.sourceforge.net/emtree/clueweb12/)\r\nfor examples of [document clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_clustering)\r\nproduced by the Parallel Streaming Signature EM-tree algorithm. The ClueWeb09\r\ndataset contains 500 million web pages and was clustered into 700,000 clusters.\r\nThe ClueWeb12 datasets contains 733 million web pages and was clustered into\r\n600,000 clusters.
